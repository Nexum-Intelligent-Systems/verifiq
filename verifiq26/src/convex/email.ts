/**
 * VerifIQ — transactional email send (Resend).
 *
 * Sprint 1 path: the "Your secure upload link" email (docs/18 voice, docs/42
 * §5.3 B3). Kept deliberately thin and dependency-free — a `fetch` to Resend's
 * REST API, available in the Convex action runtime and Node 20+ alike, so no
 * SDK and no new package are pulled in.
 *
 * If `RESEND_API_KEY` is unset (offline dev / `convex dev` without secrets) the
 * send is a no-op that reports `{ sent: false }` rather than throwing — so the
 * intake flow still creates the project + code and stays testable. The raw code
 * is NEVER logged or returned over HTTP; it travels only inside this email.
 *
 * EU sending: our recipients are EU-resident, so mail must leave from the EU.
 * Resend's region is a per-DOMAIN setting (`eu-west-1`, Ireland), not a request
 * parameter — so this module and the `api.resend.com` base URL are unchanged;
 * the EU-ness comes entirely from authenticating `EMAIL_FROM`'s domain in
 * Resend's EU region. See docs/43 §1a (incl. the US-metadata residency caveat).
