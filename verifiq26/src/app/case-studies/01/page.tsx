            The Stage 2C tender pack covered architecture, structures, M&amp;E, fire, and BCAR — five
            disciplines, 161 documents. The Employer was a public-sector body procuring under CWMF
            using PW-CF5 (Employer-Designed Works Contract). Programme pressure was real; the tender
            release date was anchored against a wider capital-programme milestone.

            VerifIQ is a software-based reading aid. It surfaces, in the documents&apos; own words,
            what a registered professional may wish to read closely. It does not certify, sign,
            opine, or substitute for professional judgement. The registered designer reads our
            output, exercises their own judgement, verifies locally, and signs. The professional
            indemnity remains theirs. We carry product-quality risk only.
