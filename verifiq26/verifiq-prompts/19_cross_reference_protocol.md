# 19 · Cross-Discipline Cross-Reference Protocol

**Use:** The mechanism by which every discipline agent reads the OTHER disciplines' drawings, schedules, notes and sections to check that its own scope items are correctly shown, noted, sized, scheduled, and coordinated across the pack. **This is the heart of the Council.** Without it, you have siloed reviewers. With it, you have a real council.

**Loaded by:** every discipline agent (file 04 + file 17). Applied after the agent's own-discipline review and before peer challenge.

---

## The principle

Every chartered designer's scope shows up in OTHER disciplines' documents. A fire compartment wall is a Fire-discipline item — but it appears on the Architect's plan, the Architect's section, the Architect's door schedule, the M&E's ductwork drawing (where fire dampers are required), the Electrical's containment drawing (where fire-stopping is required), and the Structural's drawing (where structural fire protection is required).

If the Fire Agent only reads fire documents, it cannot tell whether the design team has coordinated fire compartmentation across all those other drawings. If it tells the customer "fire strategy looks fine" without checking the rest, the customer ships a pack with fire dampers missing from the M&E drawings — and discovers it on site at a six-figure cost.

> **The cross-reference protocol forces every agent to do what a real chartered consultant does: read the rest of the pack from the perspective of their own discipline.**

---

## The protocol — 5 steps

Every discipline agent runs this after its own-discipline review.

### Step 1 — Identify own-discipline items requiring cross-reference

For every item in the agent's scope, decide whether it must appear on OTHER disciplines' documents. Use the Cross-Reference Matrix in § "The Matrix" below.

### Step 2 — Pull the target documents

Fetch the relevant documents from the project. If the document classifier has them indexed, use the index. If not, run a discipline-tagged document scan.

### Step 3 — Search for the item in each target document

For each (item × target document), search for verbatim or near-verbatim references:

- Drawing symbols (e.g., the fire-rated wall symbol on plan).
- Schedule rows (e.g., fire-rated door rows in the door schedule).
- Specification clauses (e.g., fire-stopping requirements in the M&E specification).
- Note text (e.g., "FD60s — fire door 60 minutes" beside a door tag).

### Step 4 — Compare item-by-item

For each item, classify the cross-reference result:

| Cross-reference result | What it means |
|---|---|
| Item found, consistent | Item shown on target document; matches own-discipline scope. No finding emitted. |
| Item found, inconsistent | Item shown but parameters disagree (rating, dimension, brand, location). Cross-ref finding emitted (Coordination issue). |
| Item NOT found | Item required but absent from target document. Cross-ref finding emitted (Not demonstrated or Non-compliant per discipline). |
| Item not required | Cross-reference matrix says this item shouldn't appear here. No finding. |

### Step 5 — Emit cross-reference findings

For every result in classes 2 or 3 above, emit a cross-reference finding with the augmented schema (§ "Schema additions" below). Apply the self-check protocol (file 13) before emitting — cross-reference findings must satisfy the same 7 checks as normal findings.

---

## Schema additions for cross-reference findings

The Finding object (file 05 § 05.1) gains four optional fields when used as a cross-reference finding:

```json
{
  ...standard finding fields,
  "cross_ref_anchor_discipline": "Fire",
  "cross_ref_target_disciplines": ["Architecture", "Mechanical"],
  "cross_ref_items_checked": [
    "Fire compartment walls per Fire Strategy §6.2",
    "Fire-rated doors per Fire Strategy §6.3",
    "Fire dampers per Fire Strategy §6.5"
  ],
  "cross_ref_items_found_consistent": [
    "Fire compartment walls — shown on A-100, A-101, A-102",
    "Fire-rated doors — scheduled in Door Schedule §3"
  ],
  "cross_ref_items_found_inconsistent": [
    "Fire-rated door D-15: Fire Strategy requires FD60; Door Schedule lists FD30"
  ],
  "cross_ref_items_missing": [
    "Fire dampers on ductwork crossing Compartment B/C: not shown on M&E ductwork drawing M-201; not scheduled in M&E Schedule MS-04"
  ]
}
```

The finding text then describes the missing/inconsistent items, with source quotes from BOTH the anchor document and the target document(s) where the item appears or is missing.

## Self-check protocol additions (file 13)

The Agent Self-Check Protocol gains an 8th check when running cross-references:

### Check 8 — Cross-reference completeness

> *Have I run the Cross-Reference Matrix for every item type in my discipline that requires cross-checking? For each (item × target document), have I verified found / inconsistent / missing?*

- ✅ YES → continue to emit cross-reference findings.
- ❌ NO → return to Step 3 of the protocol.

This check is binary: either the matrix was run completely, or it wasn't. Partial cross-reference runs are not allowed — they produce false-negative misses.

---

## Peer challenge interaction (file 07.1)

Cross-reference findings are special during peer challenge. The challenger should be the discipline whose document is MISSING the item — not the discipline that found it missing.

Example: Fire Agent emits a cross-reference finding that "Fire dampers absent from M&E ductwork drawing M-201." The peer challenger is the **Mechanical Agent**, not another fire reviewer. The Mechanical Agent must respond:

- **Retain** — confirms the dampers are missing; commits to revising M-201 Revision B.
- **Reject — REJ-01** — claims dampers ARE shown; provides source quote from M-201 showing them.
- **Reject — REJ-09** — claims planning grant permits a non-dampered approach.
- **Reject — REJ-10** — claims alternative compliance (fire-rated duct) signed off.

The cross-reference + peer challenge cycle is the strongest signal in the Council. Both disciplines together either agree on the gap or together explain why no gap exists.

---

## Worked example — Fire Agent cross-reference run

**Project:** the 327-finding HSE Day Service pack.

**Fire Agent own-discipline review** (complete) identified:

- Fire compartmentation strategy at Compartment Wall B/C (separating staff wing from public wing).
- 4 fire-rated doors (FD60 each) on the compartmentation line.
- 2 ductwork penetrations of the compartment line.
- 3 electrical containment crossings.
- Cause-and-effect matrix referenced but not appended (already flagged as own-discipline finding).

**Cross-reference matrix run:**

| Item | Target document | Result | Cross-ref finding? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compartment Wall B/C | Architecture plan A-101 | Found, consistent — shown as fire wall | No |
| Compartment Wall B/C | Architecture section A-301 | Found, INCONSISTENT — section shows wall stopping at ceiling, fire strategy requires full-height to underside of slab | YES (Coordination — owner: Architect) |
| 4 fire-rated doors | Architecture door schedule | Found, INCONSISTENT — door D-15 listed as FD30; fire strategy requires FD60 | YES (Coordination — owner: Architect) |
| 2 ductwork penetrations | M&E ductwork drawing M-201 | **MISSING — no fire dampers shown** | YES (Not demonstrated — owner: Mechanical) |
| 2 ductwork penetrations | M&E fire damper schedule | **MISSING — schedule lists 0 dampers** | YES (Not demonstrated — owner: Mechanical) |
| 3 containment crossings | Electrical containment drawing E-301 | Found, but **fire stopping not specified** | YES (Coordination — owner: Electrical) |
| Structural fire protection (steel beams in Compartment B) | Structural drawings | Found, consistent — intumescent 60-min specified | No |
| Fire-stopping inspection regime | BCAR ancillary cert schedule | **MISSING — no Fire-Stopping Ancillary Certifier named** | YES (Not demonstrated — owner: Assigned Certifier) |

**Cross-reference findings emitted: 5**

## Computational notes

Cross-reference is expensive. Each item × target document pair is a separate inference call. For a typical Tier III pack (600 docs, 7 disciplines), naïve full-matrix cross-reference would run ~1500–3000 LLM calls.

**Batching strategy:**

- Cluster items by target document — one call per (item-cluster × target document), not one per (item × target document).
- Cache target document content with Anthropic prompt caching (system prompt) — the target document is the same across many checks.
- Use Haiku for the search-only step ("does the item appear in this document?"); only use Sonnet for the inconsistency reasoning step.
- Target compute budget: cross-reference adds ~30% to per-pack cost (Tier III: €28 → €36).

**Skipping strategy:**

- If the target document is not uploaded, emit "Document not provided" as the cross-reference result rather than running search.
- If the project intake states a discipline is "not appointed," skip its target documents entirely.
- If the agent's own-discipline review found no items in scope, skip the cross-reference run entirely.

---

## Failure modes

| Failure | What happens | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Target document missing from upload | Cross-ref result is "document not present" — emit Not Demonstrated finding routed to the missing-document owner | Customer is told which document is required |
| Target document found but not classified to the right discipline | Cross-ref search misses the item | Document Classification Agent (file 02 Agent 2) must be tightened |
| Item exists on target document but in a non-standard symbol | Cross-ref search returns false negative | Add to negative-example library (file 13 + 15) — refine corpus pattern recognition |
| Multiple disciplines flag the same cross-ref missing item | Adjudicator merges (per file 07.2) | Adjudicator deduplication logic |
| Cross-ref finding contradicts a discipline's own review | Peer challenge surfaces this | Council Chair resolves; usually the cross-ref is right |

---

## How this changes the Council

Before file 19:

- Each discipline reviews its own documents.
- Peer challenge happens after, on findings already emitted.
- Cross-discipline gaps surface only if someone happens to notice.

After file 19:

- Each discipline reviews its own documents AND the relevant slices of every OTHER discipline's documents.
- Cross-reference findings are emitted DURING the own-discipline review, not after.
- The peer challenge is sharpened — the challenger is the owner of the MISSING item.
- The Council Chair report has structurally richer findings — most Critical findings will be cross-reference findings (because that's where coordination failures hide).

This is the difference between "AI scanning a tender pack" and "a council of chartered consultants reading each other's drawings."

---

## Single sentence

> *Every chartered designer's scope lives in everyone else's drawings — the Cross-Reference Protocol is what makes the Council read the whole pack, not just the discipline filename.*

---

*Apply the matrix on every pack. Skip nothing. The findings that this protocol surfaces are the ones that turn into six-figure variations on site.*
