# 18 · Regulatory Module Specifications

**Use:** Defines each regulatory module: trigger conditions, document set, activation rules, and which agents read against the module.

The Regulatory Trigger Agent (file 02) consults this file to decide which modules activate for a given project. Modules drive which agents run, which corpora are loaded, and which sections appear in the Build Readiness Report.

---

## Module activation logic

A module activates when EITHER:

1. The intake form explicitly flags it (e.g., "Conservation relevance: yes"), OR
2. Document classification identifies a triggering document (e.g., FSC application uploaded), OR
3. A discipline agent escalates a trigger during review (e.g., Architect Agent identifies a Protected Structure).

Once activated, the module persists for the project's lifetime — it does not deactivate even if later evidence suggests it wasn't needed (the human reviewer makes that call).

## Phase 3+ modules (not in current scope)

The following modules are spec'd but not yet built. They activate in Phase 3 onwards or per-customer demand:

- MOD-10 Conservation / Architectural Heritage
- MOD-11 Landscape + Ecology + Biodiversity
- MOD-12 Civil / Drainage / SuDS / Flood Risk
- MOD-13 Tender Risk (cross-discipline tender pack coherence)
- MOD-14 Handover Evidence (cross-discipline pre-occupation evidence)
- MOD-15 EU Procurement (above-threshold directive compliance)
- MOD-16 Data Centre (EN 50600)
- MOD-17 Major Infrastructure (TII / NTA / Eurocode + Irish NAs)
- MOD-18 EU AI Act compliance (where customer themselves uses AI in design)

Each follows the same activation / agent / report-section mapping pattern.

---

## Module versioning

Modules follow the same prompt-versioning scheme (file 15). Each module has:

- `module_version` (e.g., `mod-fsc-1.0.0`)
- Corpus version stamps for each loaded standard
- Activation rule change log

When statutory law changes (e.g., a new TGD revision), the affected module bumps version, the corpus refreshes, and the next review captures the new version in the audit log.

---

*The 9 modules above cover ~85% of Irish capital projects. The remaining ~15% (heritage, infrastructure, data centres, sector niches) live in the Phase 3+ list and activate per customer.*
