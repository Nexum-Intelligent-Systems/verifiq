VerifIQ is a checking system that helps design teams, contractors and Employer-side capital programmes identify document-quality issues in tender packs before issue — outdated standards, cut-paste from prior projects, missing schedules, FSC condition gaps, jurisdictional mis-references.

**Output is indicative. The user verifies locally. No professional opinion. No PI exposure.**

## Quick start

### View the marketing site

Open `website/index.html` in any browser. No build step. The HTML mockups use Tailwind via CDN and vanilla JavaScript for the live typing demos.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
open website/index.html

# Windows
start website/index.html
```

Site map:

- `website/index.html` → main VerifIQ marketing site
- `website/hunt.html` → contractor product (VerifIQ Hunt — variation exposure scanner)
- `website/studio.html` → sole-practitioner product (VerifIQ Studio — single-discipline)
- `website/dashboard-live.html` → Atelier console wireframe (internal reference)
- `website/three-products.html` → plain-English portfolio strategy explainer

### Review the business documents

The `docs/` folder is the canonical commercial documentation set. Open in order:

1. **Feasibility study + business plan** — the spine document. Market, model, financials, GTM, roadmap.
2. **Token economics + pricing model** — live Excel model. Edit yellow cells, margin recalculates.
3. **Systems architecture + build spec** — engineering build doc. Convex schema, API design, MVP plan.
4. **Investor prospectus** — 10-page strategic conversation pack.
5. **Week 1 GTM outreach pack** — 23 templates ready to send.
6. **Hunt variation exposure sample** — contractor product proof-of-concept output.
7. **CRM tracker** — Week 1 outreach tracking spreadsheet, live formulas.

### Review the validation evidence

The `evidence/` folder contains the anonymised output from the May 2026 validation engagement that anchors the entire VerifIQ proposition.

- **Findings register v0.8 (Scan View)** — 327 findings across 5 disciplines, source-quoted, severity-tagged.
- **Pack manifest** — 161-file inventory of the original Office project pack reviewed.

## Three products, one engine

VerifIQ ships three branded products on the same underlying checking engine:

| Product | Audience | Price | Output framing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Verify** | Design teams (architects, engineers) | €150–€800 / check | "Possible issues, please verify" |
| **Hunt** | Main contractors (pre-con, QS) | €300–€2,000 / scan | "Variation exposure with PW-CF clause mapping" |
| **Studio** | Sole practitioners, small firms | €60–€300 / check | "Single discipline, faster, cheaper" |

Plus a **Programme** tier for Employer-side capital programmes (OGP framework holders, commercial landlords, multi-site office programmes) — custom pricing, SSO, audit trail, single-tenant deployment.
