## Build Programme — 12 Weeks to First Paid Pack

**Public commitment:** 12 weeks from kick-off to first paid pack. Adopted from the Implementation Review Council (`docs/25-implementation-review-council.md`).

**Hard rules from the Council:**

- 🔴 **Week 1 gate — book the chartered reviewer panel chair conversation.** No platform build proceeds in isolation. Without panel chair signed, founder is sole reviewer through Q4 and revenue is bounded at ~€14k/month at Tier III — not seed-credible.
- 🔴 **Confirm Convex file storage limits with Convex support BEFORE Phase 1.** If they bind on 100 MB PDFs, design for S3-compatible storage from day one. Discovering this in Phase 4 wastes 4 weeks.
- 🔴 **Founder cannot have a build-only week** without a parallel panel chair recruitment week running alongside.

### Week-by-week — build + panel recruitment in parallel

| Week | Build track (per `verifiq-prompts/16_issuance_commands.md`) | Panel track | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phase 1 schema + Phase 2 LLM adapter · confirm Convex file limits | **Panel chair conversation booked + held** | Founder + Claude Code | ⚪ |
| 2 | Phase 3 six MVP agents + self-check protocol | Panel chair principle agreement | Founder + Claude Code | ⚪ |
| 3 | Phase 4 workflow orchestration + **job queue (platform mandatory #2)** | First specialist (Architecture) approached | Founder + Claude Code | ⚪ |
| 4 | Phase 5 peer challenge + Phase 6 council chair + exports | Specialist 1 onboarded (deferred honorarium) | Founder + Claude Code | ⚪ |
| 5 | Phase 7a tus.io upload + classification UX (**mandatories #1 + #4**) | Specialist 2 (Fire) approached | Founder + Claude Code | ⚪ |
| 6 | Phase 7b title-block classifier + scan-state model (**mandatories #3 + #5**) | Specialist 2 onboarded | Founder + Claude Code | ⚪ |
| 7 | Phase 7c observability + CI/CD + secrets (**mandatories #6 + #7**) | Specialist 3 (M&E) approached | Founder + Claude Code | ⚪ |
| 8 | End-to-end on 327-finding validation pack · paper prototype review with panel | All 3 specialists confirmed | Founder + panel | ⚪ |
| 9 | First chartered reviewer hand-test on validation pack | First reviewer session held | Founder + panel | ⚪ |
| 10 | Pilot brief sent to 2 friendly customers · first free taster runs | Specialist 4 (BCAR / AC) approached | Founder + customers | ⚪ |
| 11 | Phase 8 feedback loop wiring · first design-team feedback captured | Reviewer panel of 4 in place | Founder + Claude Code | ⚪ |
| 12 | **First paid pack signed and scanned** | Quarterly panel session held | Founder | 🔴 hard gate |

### Critical-path bottleneck flags

- If Week 1 panel chair conversation slips → entire end-game slips week-for-week.
- If Convex storage limits bind and not discovered until Phase 4 → 4-week regression.
- If tus.io upload breaks on the first 15 GB pack → customer permanently lost (Frontend Developer voice, `docs/25`).
- If observability not in place at first paid pack → first incident is invisible, customer trust evaporates.
- If validation-pack integration test isn't part of CI/CD → first regression hits paid customer directly.

### Platform-mandatory delivery checkpoints

| Mandatory | Spec | Owner | Due |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1 tus.io upload | `verifiq-prompts/20_platform_architecture.md` § 1 | FE build | Week 5 |
| #2 Job queue | `verifiq-prompts/20_platform_architecture.md` § 2 | BE build | Week 3 |
| #3 Title-block classifier | `verifiq-prompts/20_platform_architecture.md` § 3 | BE + vision LLM | Week 6 |
| #4 Classification-confirmation UX | `verifiq-prompts/20_platform_architecture.md` § 4 | UI build | Week 5 |
| #5 Scan-state model + email | `verifiq-prompts/20_platform_architecture.md` § 5 | BE + email | Week 6 |
| #6 Observability | `verifiq-prompts/20_platform_architecture.md` § 6 | Founder | Week 7 |
| #7 CI/CD + validation pack | `verifiq-prompts/20_platform_architecture.md` § 7 | Founder | Week 7 |

### Council-deferred to Phase 2

These were council-recommended but explicitly Phase 2 to keep MVP shippable in 12 weeks:

- ISO 19650 standardiser as customer-facing free bonus (**deferred to post-launch success — founder decision 2026-06**)
- Drawing comparison (Rev A vs Rev B)
- Cost-impact estimator on Critical findings
- Programme-impact analyser
- Real-time scan-state push to Slack / Teams
- Anonymised principle-level peer comparison
- Cryptographic audit-log signature (Phase 3)

## Weekly cadence — the meeting with yourself

**Every Monday 9am — 15 minutes:**

1. Strike through completed items above.
2. Move incomplete items to current week.
3. Check the trigger map — has anything fired since last Monday?
4. Cash check — did anything spent exceed the phase budget?
5. Red-line check — any of the 12 red lines at risk?
6. Update "Last reviewed" date at top.
7. If anything blocks, escalate (to yourself, to GovIQ co-founder if any, to advisor).

**Every Friday 5pm — 10 minutes:**

1. What did I commit to this week that didn't ship?
2. Why?
3. What's the smallest next step that unblocks it?
4. Roll into Monday's plan.
